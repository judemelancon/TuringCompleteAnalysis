# Code of Conduct

The standard here is to maintain a polite, professional tone while conducting relevant discussions. It does not matter what might be appropriate for a conversation in any other place.

Criticisms of the project are definitely germane and are allowed. Generalizing criticisms to the contributors is neither germane nor allowed.

More broadly, do not bring up any real or fictional person for the simple reason that it's irrelevant. _Particularly_ avoid even the suggestion of a personal attack.

Harassment elsewhere is also disallowed.

Suspected violations may be reported to the maintainers.

A first-time non-egregious violation will result in a warning with a reference to this Code of Conduct. Any other violation will result in a block.

If someone finds a way to behave badly that isn't covered, this policy will be amended until it is.
