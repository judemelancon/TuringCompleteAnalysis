# Turing Complete Analysis

This is an unofficial tool for analysis of the scores for the game [_Turing Complete_](https://turingcomplete.game/).
The game starts with basic logic gates and builds to assembly programming on a computer built by the player to their own design.
Eventually, players unlock scoring based on gates, delay, and ticks.
This tool generates leaderboards, displays placements by player, shows level score statistics, and makes charts.

## Getting Started

This is just the most straightforward way.

* Install [LINQPad 6 or higher](https://www.linqpad.net/), keeping its default to associate with `.linq` files.
* Download the script and save it with the `.linq` extension.
  * For example, use "Save link as..." or equivalent on [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/judemelancon/TuringCompleteAnalysis/main/Scripts/Analyze%20Turing%20Complete%20Profiles%20and%20Scores.linq).
* Double-click the downloaded `.linq` file.
* Run with the play button or the F5 key.
