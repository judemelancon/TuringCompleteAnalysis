## Process

1. If you intend to expend enough effort that you'd be offended by rejection, ask about acceptance first. Opening an issue for this is fine.
2. Submit a pull request.
    * Pull requests are subject to [the project's licensing](LICENSE.md).
    * The standards for scripts will be refined if they come up.
    * Any language that's easy enough to review would potentially be accepted.
      * Even duplicates of existing scripts would potentially be accepted (as an addition, not a replacement).
3. Wait for it to be approved. This shouldn't take inordinately long.
